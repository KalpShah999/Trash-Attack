This folder contains a Unity Project for the game "Trash Attack". To open the folder, Unity version 2020.1.0b2 or higher is required. 

If you do not have Unity installed, or you just want to see the final version of the game, you can run the program from the "/Builds" folder. 
  There are builds for both MacOS and Windows. Click on the folder with your platform name on it and then run the file inside. 
    For windows as well, there is an installer attached that allows you to install the game on the fly, making it a much more compact version of the game.
